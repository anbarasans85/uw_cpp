* I used Linux g++ for compilation and running the executable.
* I could have placed the test cpp files in the same folder with single copy of CppUnitLite source files but I have placed in separate folders for better organization and easy future reference.
Newly added files:
* For question1: swap.h, swap.cpp, SwapTest.cpp
* For question2: StringStreamTest.cpp
* For question3: StringStreamSortTest.cpp
* For question4: cat.h, cat.cpp, CatTest.cpp 

Answer to question 4: using string type in cpp is easier and it is concise compared to c implementation of strcat.
