Answer to question1:

When a object is passed by value, copy of object is created and copy constructor is called.

Below, each step indicates default constructor, copy constructor and destructor count in the format (default,copy,destructor)

1. In main: object created (default constructor) - (1,0,0)
2. In main: Invoking f1: object created (copy constructor) - (1,1,0)
3. In f1: object created (default constructor) - (2,1,0)
4. In f1: Invoking f2: object created (copy constructor) - (2,2,0)
5. In f2: object created (copy constructor) - (2,3,0)
6. In f2: invoking f3: object is not passed by value and no constructor is called - (2,3,0)
7. In f3: invoking f4: object is not passed by value and no constructor is called - (2,3,0)
8. When functions return (f4,f3,f2,f1,main), destructors are called and destructor counts to 5 when main returns. (2,3,5)

In total:
default constructor - 2 times
copy constructor - 2 times
destructor - 5 times
