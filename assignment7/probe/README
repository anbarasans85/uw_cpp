1. CharQueue1, CharQueue2 cpp and .h files are implemented.
2. CharQueue .cpp and .h are also included. (In the discussion thread it was mentioned that CharQueue.h is not needed but I could not avoid it.)
3. CharQueue uses CharQueue1 for its queue implementation. This can be changed to CharQueue2 which uses a array.

Due to assignment deadline time, I could not implement many requirements:
1. CharQueue2 array that needs to grow dynamically. But I did array limited by MAX_QUEUE_SIZE macro.
2. If I had used heap, I may have used copy constructor. I did not use copy constructor for this assignment.

I will refer to the solution and learn from it.
